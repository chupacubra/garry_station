# garry_station
experimental idea of making the ss13

#The idea is to increase the fun
Garry's mod is the best place to replicate some of the features of this game.

And besides, shootouts in this mode will become more exciting. 
I want to see this mode with a huge number of different jokes like a "Comically long revolver" that blows your head off, or people screaming into a common radio channel (using a radio chat). There is also a desire to create a simple integration of various objects by type of Media Player and so on.

So far, only the development of a health system and the basis of items is being carried out.

!!!think through!!!

CRIT/SHOCK, ragdolise a person without data loss or SWEP;
The system of organs and bones. Do we need organs at all? Slowing down and increasing spread with broken bones;
DEATH. transition to observers and intensive care;
redo rp_boxstation. Remove gravity in space and lower the damage to zero (for catching a spacewalk). Add at least a cargo shuttle
